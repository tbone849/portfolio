				<p class='fs-title'>My name is Tim Sarvey. I am a web developer with a passion for clean design that also stands out from the crowd. Since 2009, I have been casually freelance developing and now I am looking to shift careers into developing full time. I am currently for hire, so checkout some of my projects below.</p>

				<span class='fs-display-1 title'>My Background</span>
				<p class='fs-title'>Believe it or not, I come from a musical background. In 2008, I graduated from IUP with a Bachelor's Degree in Music Ed. I continued my education with a Master's Degree in Music Tech from IUPUI. During my time as an educator, I was a substitute teacher, Assistant Band Director, and, of course, freelance developer. It wasn't until my master's degree that I discovered my love for developing. Fast forwarding to today, I now have a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from UMass.</p>
