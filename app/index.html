			<blurb header='Who am I?' class='item'>
				My name is Tim Sarvey. I am a web developer with a passion for clean design that also stands out from the crowd. Since 2009, I have been casually freelance developing and now I am looking to shift careers into developing full time. I am currently for hire, so checkout some of my projects below.

			<blurb header='My Background' class='item'>
				Believe it or not, I come from a musical background. In 2008, I graduated from IUP with a Bachelor's Degree in Music Ed. I continued my education with a Master's Degree in Music Tech from IUPUI. During my time as an educator, I was a substitute teacher, Assistant Band Director, and, of course, freelance developer. It wasn't until my master's degree that I discovered my love for developing. Fast forwarding to today, I now have a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from UMass.

			<blurb header='Languages' class='item'>
				I have a pretty broad language base, but my strongest languages are HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Other languages I have encountered are C, Java, Perl, Python, PHP, and XML. I am always open to learning new languages.
			</blurb>
			<blurb header='Frameworks/Libraries/Tools' class='item'>
				I have experience with jQuery, jQueryUI, Ajax, AngularJS, and Lumx. Again, I am open to any framework or library. It is always fun to see what options are out there and to see what they offer! As far as my editing enironmnet is concerned, I use Sublime, Git, GitHub, Gulp, SASS, Bourbon Neat, and JSHint (just to name a little bit).
